        <h4 className="font-bold">How to choose my size?</h4>
        <p>
          All products we sell on the site are in European size. If you are not
          sure about what size to choose, please refer to our size chart.

        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">When can I expect my order?</h4>
        <p>
          We usually ship an order out within 1-3 working days (excluding
          weekends). Handling time: 1-3 working days. Order over 10 items may
          take a little longer Transit time: You may expect to receive your
          order within 5 – 25 business days. It depends on which shipment method
          you use.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">How can I cancel my order?</h4>
        <p>
          You need to contact us to cancel. If the item in your order has not
          been printed or shipped, we will cancel it for you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">How do I track my order?</h4>
        <p>
          After your order is shipped, we will send you an email to keep you
          informed. So please make sure you provide the correct email address
          and add our email address to your white-list. If there are multiple
          items in an order, they will be divided and shipped in different
          packages which will have separate delivery dates and tracking
          information.

        <h4 className="font-bold">
          What is the solution if the package gets lost?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Please don’t worry! If your package gets lost, please email us or send
          a message on our site, and we will send a new package to you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">Do you charge tax?</h4>
        <p>
          We do not charge tax, but your local customs officials may charge some
          tax before allowing the item to enter your country, and the carrier
          usually pays the tax for you and ask for a pay-back from you in
          delivery. You are responsible for ALL customs fees (including duties,
          taxes, brokerage fees, and any other fees) assessed at the border
          before delivery.

          If I make some mistakes in my order, how can I correct them?
        </h4>
        <p>
          You can change your order details by contacting us before your order
          gets shipped, but the handling time in such a situation will take
          longer than usual. To ensure smooth delivery, please check and confirm
          your order details before you submit the order. If the order has been
          shipped, we can not change your order details. Please understand.
