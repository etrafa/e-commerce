        <h4 className="font-bold">Tax Charges</h4>
        <p>
          Customs can often charge duty on imports into certain countries. We
          have no control over this and cannot be held responsible for any
          import taxes/duties that may be charged. These taxes go to the
          government of the country that you are importing the goods and not to
          hnfootball.ru. You will be liable for any charges incurred due to
          import taxes. It is illegal to undervalue/mark as a gift any parcel to
          avoid paying duty, so please don’t ask us to do this, as any requests
          will be ignored.
        </p>
